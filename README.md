# Usage:

> 1. Run the script ( py AntiToxicCommunity.py ) 
> 2. Join in a game ( League Of Legends )
> 3. Open your chat with **ENTER** ( Btw League Of Legends has protection and you can't open the chat via a python script )
> 4. Click **DEL** button and the script will mute all players
> 5. You can change the KeyBind button from the file

# Yes, I'm so lazy to write "/mute all" that I wrote a whole script for that
