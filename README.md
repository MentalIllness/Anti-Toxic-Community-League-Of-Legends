# Version 2.0 USAGE:

> 1. Run the script ( py AntiToxicCommunity.py ) 
> 2. Join in a game ( League Of Legends )
> 3. Click **DEL** button and the script will mute all players
> 4. You can change the KeyBind button from the file
> 5. Version 1.0 was so trash tbh so I updated it...

# Yes, I'm so lazy to write "/mute all" that I wrote a whole script for that
